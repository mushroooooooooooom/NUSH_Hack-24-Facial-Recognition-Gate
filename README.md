# NUSH_Hack-24-Facial-Recognition-Gate
This program uses facial recognition to detect identity, opening the doors to the staff room if they detect a teacher/student. This removes the need to pull out their wallet, grab their card. teachers can easily enter even when their carring books, have forgotten their axcess card, or in a hurry!
